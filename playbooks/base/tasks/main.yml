#
# I've tried to set this up to handle upgrades but that seems to be fraught
# with peril (the issues are too many to enumerate). So I've pretty much just
# set this up to ensure the apps are installed, but that's it. This means that
# I can upgrade apps via their automatic upgrade feature or just via brew
# directly.
#
# In addition, we use 'accept_external_apps' which means that the task should
# basically no-op regardless of how the app got installed (i.e. whether our
# task did it or not). That seems to be buggy though and doesn't always work.
# The workaround for an app in that case is to uninstall it and then either
# install it via brew or this playbook, afterwhich, it's all good.
