      The com.googlecode.iterm2.plist file in this directory is a localized
      (i.e. updated for current user home dir locations) version of the one
      maintained in the mac-provision git repository.

      iTerm should be configured to read/write its configuration here.

      Any changes worth keeping should be back-ported to the mac-provision
      repository version.
