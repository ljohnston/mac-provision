# The "environment:" stuff here kind of a hack. Seems ansible passes the
# existing environment when sudoing. For me, that includes asdf, which is
# managing my python env. This creates all kinds of grief when sudo'ed.  I
# could munge my path to remove the asdf stuff, but it seems all we need in 
# the path is '/usr/bin'.
